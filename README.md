# docker-configs
GItHub Repo to stash custom docker configuration files.

Each configuration file should be contained within it's own directory, with any other necessary files and an associated readme.md file describing what the config covers etc.

There's also a docker maintained page where they have [samples available (Click here)](https://docs.docker.com/samples/).
